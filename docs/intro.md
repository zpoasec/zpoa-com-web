title: Welcome to ZPOA Shield
---

ZPOA Shield is a unified cybersecurity SaaS platform designed to consolidate your entire security operations into a single pane of glass. Rather than juggling dozens of disconnected tools, ZPOA Shield brings detection, compliance, asset discovery, hardening, network defense, and AI-driven intelligence together under one roof.

## The Platform at a Glance

ZPOA Shield is built around six core modules, each addressing a critical pillar of modern cybersecurity:

- **Detect (SIEM)** -- Real-time log ingestion, correlation, and alerting. Ingest data from across your infrastructure and surface threats as they emerge.
- **Comply (GRC)** -- AI-powered compliance management with automated posture assessment, a conversational Compliance Copilot, AI policy generation, evidence validation, audit readiness reports, and cross-framework inheritance across SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and more.
- **Discover (Asset Inventory)** -- Continuous discovery and classification of every asset in your environment, from cloud workloads to on-premises endpoints.
- **Armor (Endpoint Protection)** -- Endpoint hardening, vulnerability management, and patch orchestration to reduce your attack surface.
- **Fortress (Network Security)** -- Network segmentation analysis, firewall rule auditing, and traffic anomaly detection to protect your perimeter and internal zones.
- **Neural Mesh (AI Engine)** -- An AI-powered intelligence layer that correlates signals across all modules, identifies complex attack chains, and provides actionable recommendations.

## 90+ Integrations

ZPOA Shield connects to the tools and platforms you already use. With over 90 pre-built integrations spanning cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), identity providers (Okta, Azure AD), endpoint agents, SaaS applications, network devices, and ticketing systems, you can start ingesting data within minutes of signing up.

## A Single Pane of Glass

Security teams waste valuable time context-switching between tools. ZPOA Shield eliminates that friction by providing a unified dashboard where you can monitor alerts, track compliance posture, review asset inventory, and investigate incidents -- all without leaving the platform. Role-based access controls ensure every team member sees exactly what they need.

## Who Is ZPOA Shield For?

- **Security Operations Centers (SOC)** looking to centralize detection and response.
- **Compliance and GRC teams** managing multi-framework obligations.
- **IT and DevOps teams** seeking visibility into cloud and hybrid infrastructure.
- **CISOs and security leaders** who need executive-level reporting and risk metrics.
