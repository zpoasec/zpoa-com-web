# Productivity Analytics

Workforce productivity analytics powered by real activity data. Understand how time is spent across applications, websites, and tasks -- with per-user, per-team, and organization-wide views.

## User Productivity

View daily and weekly productivity metrics for individual users:

- **Productivity score** -- Weighted percentage of time spent in productive applications
- **Active hours** -- Total time with keyboard/mouse activity (excludes idle)
- **App breakdown** -- Pie chart of time distribution across application categories
- **Daily trend** -- Productivity score over the past 30 days
- **Top applications** -- Ranked list of most-used apps with time spent and category

## Team Productivity

Aggregate productivity metrics across teams and departments:

- **Department comparison** -- Side-by-side productivity scores for each team
- **Top performers** -- Users with the highest productivity scores (opt-in, privacy-respecting)
- **Work pattern analysis** -- Average start time, end time, and peak productive hours by team
- **App utilization** -- Which apps each team uses most and how productivity correlates

## Application Categories

Manage how applications are classified for productivity scoring:

- **Productive** -- Applications that contribute to work output (IDE, Office, CRM, ERP)
- **Unproductive** -- Applications that do not contribute to work (social media, gaming, streaming)
- **Neutral** -- Applications that are neither productive nor unproductive (system utilities, file managers)
- **Custom weights** -- Assign a productivity weight (0.0 to 1.0) to each app for nuanced scoring

Categories can be managed globally or per-department. New applications are detected automatically and start as neutral until categorized.

## Web Categories

Classify web domains for productivity and security tracking:

- Domain-level categorization (social media, news, shopping, developer tools, etc.)
- Bulk categorization via domain lists
- Auto-categorization for well-known domains
- Custom categories for industry-specific sites
