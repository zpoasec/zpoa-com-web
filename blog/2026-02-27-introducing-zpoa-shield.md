Today we are excited to announce **Z Shield**, a unified cybersecurity platform that brings together six critical security functions into a single pane of glass.

## The Problem

Security teams today are overwhelmed by tool sprawl. The average enterprise uses 45-75 different security tools, each with its own console, alert format, and data silo. This fragmentation leads to:

- **Alert fatigue** from thousands of disconnected notifications
- **Slow response times** due to context-switching between tools
- **Blind spots** where threats slip through the cracks
- **High costs** from overlapping vendor licenses

## Our Solution

Z Shield consolidates the core security functions that every organization needs:

- **DETECT** -- Next-generation SIEM with real-time log ingestion, correlation engine, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- **COMPLY** -- Automated compliance management for SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, NIST, and GDPR
- **DISCOVER** -- Asset discovery and vulnerability management with CVSS/EPSS scoring
- **ARMOR** -- Cloud Security Posture Management across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **FORTRESS** -- Identity security with access governance and anomaly detection
- **NEURAL MESH** -- AI-powered security investigations and threat intelligence

## 90+ Integrations

We ship with connectors for the tools you already use -- from CrowdStrike and SentinelOne to Okta and Palo Alto Networks. Connect your existing security stack in minutes and start correlating data across your entire environment.
